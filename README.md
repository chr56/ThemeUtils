# ThemeUtils


## What's This?

This was once a part of [app-theme-helper](https://github.com/kabouzeid/app-theme-helper).

This is used for [Phonograph Plus](https://github.com/chr56/Phonograph_Plus).

I reorganized and refactor these codes, now this is just library to caculate theme color and handle
view tint.

## Original README digest

### App Theme Helper

This is basically a copy of [App Theme Engine](https://github.com/afollestad/app-theme-engine)
by [Aidan Follestad](https://github.com/afollestad) which only includes the "Config" part. This
library is only for saving and querying theme values. The user is responsible to use those values (
applying to Views), unlike ATE this library won't automatically theme your views. As an extra this
library includes a few Util methods from ATE and myself to make theming easy.
